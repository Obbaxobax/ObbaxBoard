A stupid soundboard
Idk what im doing

## If someone actually wants to use this
To add sounds place them in the sounds folder. (Right click and refresh if sounds are added while the app is running) <br>
By default, hotkeys will activate whenever the keys are pressed, regardless of if other keys are pressed. Holding left alt while assigning the hotkeys will ensure that they will not trigger unless ONLY the assigned keys are pressed. <br>
Simply click the assignment button twice to clear hotkey. <br>
Audio routing is your job I dont know what im doing. <br>
