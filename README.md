# ObbaxBoard
A very simple soundboard.

## How to use
To add sounds place them in the sounds folder. (Right click and refresh if sounds are added while the app is running) <br>
By default, hotkeys will activate whenever the keys are pressed, regardless of if other keys are pressed. Holding left alt while assigning the hotkeys will ensure that they will not trigger unless ONLY the assigned keys are pressed. <br>
Simply click the assignment button twice to clear hotkey. <br>
As of current, you must route the audio yourself. (I.E. using voicemeeter or a virtual audio cable) <br>
